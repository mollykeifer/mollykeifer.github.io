    "text": "Jets fans haven’t seen the post season since 2010, let alone have a winning record since the 2015-2016 season. But when drafting Zach Wilson as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, behind Trevor Lawrence, there was some hope that things would begin to head in the right direction.\nWilson was a three-year starter at BYU before declaring early for the NFL draft. He finished his collegiate career with a 67.6% passing completion rate for 7,652 passing yards and 56 touchdowns.\nHis rookie season in the NFL didn’t necessarily go as planned. The Jets finished 4-13 with Wilson starting 13 of the 17 games played. The 2022 season went similarly. However, seven games were won, and that was an improvement from the four games the previous season.\nJust before the 2023 season, the Jets signed Aaron Rodgers as their starting quarterback. And again, hope began to brew for Jets fans. But four snaps into the season and Rodgers tore his Achilles tendon, calling Wilson into the game.\nThe 2023 season also concluded with only seven wins. Another devastating year for Jets fans and people began to wonder; is Zach Wilson the worst quarterback in the NFL?\nLet’s take a look at some numbers.\nWhere does Zach Wilson stand in passing yards per game compared to others in his draft class?\nHere’s some notable quarterbacks from his draft class who have passed over 100 yards per game.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nseasonlogscombined &lt;- read_csv(\"seasonspassingcombined.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\", Player))\n\nqbYPG &lt;- seasonlogscombined |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\") |&gt;\n  filter(Att &gt; 100) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Season) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    YardsperGame = sum(`Y/G`)\n  )\n\nzw &lt;- qbYPG |&gt; filter(Player == \"Zach Wilson\")\n\npm &lt;- qbYPG |&gt; filter(Player == \"Patrick Mahomes\") \n\ntrevorlawrence &lt;- qbYPG |&gt; filter(Player == \"Trevor Lawrence\")\n\nmacjones &lt;- qbYPG |&gt; filter(Player == \"Mac Jones\")\n\njustinfields &lt;- qbYPG |&gt; filter(Player == \"Justin Fields\")\n\nqbs21 &lt;- bind_rows(trevorlawrence, macjones, zw, justinfields)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=qbYPG, aes(y=Season, x=YardsperGame), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=zw, aes(y=Season, x=YardsperGame), color=\"#125740\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=trevorlawrence, aes(y=Season, x=YardsperGame), color=\"#008E97\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=macjones, aes(y=Season, x=YardsperGame), color=\"#C60C30\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=justinfields, aes(y=Season, x=YardsperGame), color=\"#F26522\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=qbs21, aes(y=Season,x=YardsperGame, label=Player), nudge_y = .1, nudge_x = .2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2021, 2022, 2023)) +\n  labs(\n   x=\"Passing Yards per Game\", \n   y=\"\", \n   title=\"Justin Fields surpasses Zach Wilson\", \n   subtitle=\"Zach Wilson drops to being one of the worst in passing yards out of the 2021 quarterback draft class.\",\n   caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Molly Keifer\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part, Zach Wilson has stayed consistent through his first three seasons. Justin Fields is the only quarterback behind Wilson for the 2021 and 2022 seasons sitting at around 150 yards per game. Wilson fell behind Fields for the 2023 season, putting him in last in passing yards per game out of the notable quarterbacks in his draft class.\nBut what about the quarterbacks since Wilson has been drafted? Where does he rank when it comes to completing passes?\n\n\nCode\nallseasons &lt;- read_csv(\"seasonspassingcombined.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\", Player))\n\nqbs &lt;- allseasons |&gt;\n  filter (Pos == \"QB\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    comp_pct = mean(`Cmp%`)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter (comp_pct &gt; 50)\n\nzw &lt;- qbs |&gt; filter(Player == \"Zach Wilson\")\n\ntrevorlawrence &lt;- qbs |&gt; filter(Player == \"Trevor Lawrence\")\n\nmacjones &lt;- qbs |&gt; filter(Player == \"Mac Jones\")\n\njustinfields &lt;- qbs |&gt; filter(Player == \"Justin Fields\")\n\ntreylance &lt;- qbs |&gt; filter(Player == \"Trey Lance\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=qbs, aes(x=reorder(Player, comp_pct), weight=comp_pct), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=zw, aes(x=reorder(Player, comp_pct), weight=comp_pct), fill=\"#125740\") +\n  geom_bar(data=trevorlawrence, aes(x=reorder(Player, comp_pct), weight=comp_pct), fill=\"#008E97\") +\n  geom_bar(data=macjones, aes(x=reorder(Player, comp_pct), weight=comp_pct), fill=\"#C60C30\") +\n  geom_bar(data=justinfields, aes(x=reorder(Player, comp_pct), weight=comp_pct), fill=\"#F26522\") +\n  geom_bar(data=treylance, aes(x=reorder(Player, comp_pct), weight=comp_pct), fill=\"#B3995D\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n   x=\"\", \n   y=\"Average Completion Percentage\", \n   title=\"Zach Wilson finishes second to last in his draft class\", \n   subtitle=\"For Zach Wilson's career, his average completion percentage is just over 50%.\", \n   caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Molly Keifer\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the others in Wilson’s draft class, he is only ahead of Trey Lance. Both players are just over 50% completion, compared to others like Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa who are closer to the 75% range. Lance has also played 25 less games than Wilson.\nHow many of those throws lead to a touchdown or an interception?\n\n\nCode\nseasonscombined &lt;- read_csv(\"seasonspassingcombined.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\", Player))\n\nqbtd &lt;- seasonscombined |&gt;\n  filter (Pos == \"QB\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalTD = sum(TD),\n    TotalInt = sum(Int)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(TotalTD &gt; 20)\n\nqbtdwide &lt;- qbtd |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"TD\")\n\nwilson &lt;- qbtdwide |&gt; filter(Player == \"Zach Wilson\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=qbtdwide, aes(x=reorder(Player, TD), weight=TD, fill=Type)) + \n  geom_bar(data=wilson, aes(x=Player, weight=TD, fill= Type), color= \"black\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\",\"#77DD77\"), labels=c(\"Total Interceptions\", \"Total Touchdowns\"), name=\"2021-2023 Seasons\") +\n  labs(\n   x=\"\", \n   y=\"\", \n   title=\"Zach Wilson's career combines for a total of 23 touchdowns\", \n   subtitle=\"C.J.

The second overall pick for the 2023 NFL Draft, C.J. Stroud, has thrown for 23 touchdowns and five interceptions his first season, while only playing 15 games.\nZach Wilson may not be the worst quarterback in the NFL, but he does stick out from the rest of the quarterbacks in his draft class."
